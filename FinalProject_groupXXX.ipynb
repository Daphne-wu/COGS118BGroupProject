    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "As technology and social media becomes more integrated into our society, it is becoming an increasingly viable tool for tracking social trends on larger scales than previously available. One of the most heartbreaking and devastating social trends in any society is suicide prevelance. Understanding correlations between real-world suicide rates and online discussions of mental health issues could give invaluable insights into predicting and surveilling related trends and potential risk factors. There has been a great deal of research monitoring suicide rates in the United States and abroad. Other bodies of research have also been dedicated to tracking social media as a measurement tool for the prevalence of mental health issues. One such study assessed linguistic trends shared by Twitter users diagnosed with depression, using a probabilistic model to determine if certain posting habits could indicate major depression in individuals <a name=\"DeChoudhury\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#DeChoudhury). Published in 2013, it indicated that 27 million Americans likely suffer from clinical depression, which was predicted to account for more than 30,000 suicides per year at the time. Since then, the population of the United States, prevalence of social media in everyday life, and suicide rates within the nation have all increased. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, surveys in 2020 tracked reported suicides within the United States as having reached past 45,000 <a name=\"nimhnote\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#NIMH). This is a 50% increase in a matter of 7 years. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, there are studies that showed a positive correlation between cyberbullying, depression, suicidal ideation, suicidal plans, and suicide attempts, along with correlation between internet addiction and suicidality. Cyberbullying not only affects the victim, but also the perpertrator(s) as well which exposes at least 2 individuals to higher depression and behavioral issues. Cyberbullying also poses a greater threat as studies have shown that bullying through the internet increases the risk of suicidal ideation by a factor of 3.12 compared to traditional bullying’s factor of 2.16. <a name=\"ncbinote\"></a>[<sup>[4]</sup>](#ncbi). The more negative feedback that children receive onlines from strangers lowers their self-esteem and feelings of self-worth, and the more time spend on the internet increases the amount of exposure to these comments. Online victims are also more isolated than in person victims, making it more difficult for others to witness and potentially intervene. \n"

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project aims to identify tweets indicating suicide risk through sentiment analysis. After preprocessing the data using term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf), VADER sentiment analysis, and principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, we further analyzed the data using clustering techniques such as K-means and DBSCAN. In particular, we utilized the VADER sentiment analysis tool in conjunction with a bag-of-words approach, which involves categorizing words as positive or negative to assess the sentiment of tweets. We will employ a pre-trained sentiment analysis model like VADER, which can be directly imported and applied to the tweet data to extract sentiment scores. For sentiment analysis, we are utilizing a bag-of-words approach with predefined lists of positive and negative words, omitting the need for word embeddings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our problem is quantifiable as it involves analyzing sentiment scores assigned to tweets, which can be expressed mathematically. The problem is measurable through metrics such as sentiment polarity scores and clustering performance metrics like silhouette score or Davies–Bouldin index. Additionally, the problem is replicable as it can be reproduced with different datasets and contexts, ensuring the generalizability of findings.\n"

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach we are using to dentify tweets that indicate suicide risk involves a multiple step process to leverage sentiment analysis techniques combined with clustering algorithms. After preprocessing the tweets using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to extract features, we apply the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) sentiment analysis tool to assign sentiment scores to each tweet. Then, we reduce the dimensionality of the feature space using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to capture the most significant information while minimizing computational complexity. After the preprocessing steps, we will use two clustering algorithms, K-means and DBSCAN, to partition the tweets into distinct groups based on their sentiment and content similarities. K-means partitions the data into K clusters, where K is determined through experimentation or domain knowledge. DBSCAN, on the other hand, identifies dense regions of tweets in the feature space, allowing for the detection of outliers and noise. To incorporate sentiment analysis with a bag-of-words approach using VADER, we assign sentiment scores to individual words in each tweet based on their presence in lists of positive and negative words. These sentiment scores are then aggregated to derive an overall sentiment score for each tweet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Preprocessing: We'll use Python's scikit-learn library to perform TF-IDF transformation and PCA for dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "- Sentiment Analysis: VADER sentiment analysis will be implemented using the nltk library in Python.\n",
    "- Clustering Algorithms: K-means and DBSCAN will be implemented using the scikit-learn library.\n",
    "- Bag-of-Words Approach: We'll use custom scripts to assign sentiment scores to words based on predefined lists of positive and negative words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation:\n",
    "To evaluate the effectiveness of our solution, we'll use labeled datasets to assess the accuracy of identifying tweets indicating suicide risk. We'll compare the clustering results obtained from K-means and DBSCAN against the ground truth labels to measure clustering performance. Additionally, we'll assess the correlation between sentiment scores assigned to tweets and their corresponding ground truth labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benchmark Model:\n",
    "As a benchmark model, we'll compare our solution's performance against a baseline model that employs basic text processing techniques without sentiment analysis. This baseline model may involve simple clustering algorithms applied directly to the TF-IDF transformed data without incorporating sentiment scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this approach, our goal is to to provide a robust and interpretable solution for identifying tweets indicating suicide risk, using te power of sentiment analysis and clustering techniques."
